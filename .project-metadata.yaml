runtimes:
  - editor: JupyterLab ## Other acceptable values are determined by the runtimes available in your CML environment
    kernel: Python 3.11 ## Same here, check your runtimes (custom runtimes can be added as well)
    edition: Standard ## Particularly relevant if using GPUs, Nvidia GPU

## Below are some sample tasks based on some of the most popular aspects of AMP creation.
