Creating a Session using the CDE CLI [Technical Preview]
The cde session create command allows you to create a new
    Session.

Run the following command in the CDE CLI: 

cde session create --name <session-name> --type <pyspark/spark-scala>

You can enable the GPU acceleration using
                the[--enable-gpu-acceleration] flag during the spark session creation.cde session create --name test-session --type spark-scala \
--enable-gpu-acceleration
To accelerate session queries on specific hardware, you can use
                    [--executor-node-selector "nvidia.com/gpu=A100"] and
                    [--executor-node-toleration "nvidia.com/gpu=true"] options to
                  configure selectors and tolerations if you want to run the job on specific GPU
                  nodes. You can only provide executor node selectors and tolerations, as GPUs are
                  used by executors only. The selector and
                    tolerations CLI options are optional. You can use either one or
                  both in congestion with --enable-gpu-acceleration flag.For
                    example:cde session create --name test-session --type spark-scala \
                    --enable-gpu-acceleration \
                    --executor-node-selector "nvidia.com/gpu=A100" \
                    --executor-node-toleration "nvidia.com/gpu=true"
