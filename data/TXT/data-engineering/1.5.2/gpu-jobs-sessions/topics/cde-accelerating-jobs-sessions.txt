Accelerating CDE Jobs and Sessions
You can accelerate your Spark jobs and Sessions using GPUs after you add GPU resources
    to the CDE service and virtual cluster. Perform the following to use GPU resources:



Create a CDE service with GPU quota.


Create a virtual cluster in that CDE service with GPU
                quota.


Enable GPU acceleration when creating Spark jobs using CDE UI or when running
            jobs using CDE CLI.

Enable GPU acceleration when creating a session using CDE UI or CDE CLI.
Check whether the Spark job or session ran using the
              GPU resources.
