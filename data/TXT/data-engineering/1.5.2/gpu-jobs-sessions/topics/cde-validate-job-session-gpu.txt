Validating your Spark job or session run
After you run a job that utilizes the GPUs, you can verify if the GPUs were used. If
    you run any SQL query, you will observe GPU Filters in the SQL query plan in the "History Server
    UI" or in the Driver logs. Spark JobSessions
You can check if the GPUs were utilized in the Job run using the SQL query.

In the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) console, click the

              Data Engineering tile. The CDE Home page
            displays.
Click Jobs Runs on the left navigation menu. The Job
              Runs page displays. 
Click on the job Run Id of the job which utilized GPU. 
Click the Spark UI tab and click SQL. The
            SQL plan is displayed which shows that the job has utilized the GPUs. noteThis GPU details  appears only if the job utilizes the GPU.

              Otherwise, job requests for GPU but never utilizes it. 


You can check if the GPUs were utilized by creating a session with Scala type. Open a
          session terminal and execute the below sample Scala
          code.val df = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(Seq(1)).toDF()
df.createOrReplaceTempView("df")
spark.sql("SELECT value FROM df WHERE value <>1").show
spark.sql("SELECT value FROM df WHERE value <>1").explain
This should output a SQL plan with GPU Filter as below.
