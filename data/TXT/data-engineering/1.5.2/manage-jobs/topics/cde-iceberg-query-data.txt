Querying data in an Iceberg table
To read the Iceberg table, you can use SparkSQL to query the Iceberg tables. 
Example:spark.sql("select * from ice_t").show(1000, false)importantWhen querying Iceberg tables in HDFS, CDS disables
        locality by default. Because enabling locality generally leads to increased Spark planning
        time for queries on such tables and often the increase is quite significant. If you wish to
        enable locality, set the spark.cloudera.iceberg.locality.enabled to
          true . For example, you can do it by passing --conf
          spark.cloudera.iceberg.locality.enabled=true to your
          spark3-submit command.
