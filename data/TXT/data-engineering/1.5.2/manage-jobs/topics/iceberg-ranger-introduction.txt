Accessing Iceberg tables
CDP uses Apache Ranger to provide centralized security administration and management.
  The Ranger Admin UI is the central interface for security administration. You can use Ranger to
  create two policies that allow users to query Iceberg tables.
How you open the Ranger Admin UI differs from one CDP service to another. In Management
   Console, you can select your environment, and then click Environment Details > Quick Links > Ranger. 

You log into the Ranger Admin UI, and the Ranger Service Manager appears.
