Activating Python environment resources 
Airflow-related deployments must be configured to use the new Python environment and
    have to be restarted to use the newly created Python environment.
noteOnly one Python environment can be active at one time. This command restarts the Airflow
          services. You must ensure that no jobs are running when activating the Python
          environment.
The Python resource must be in the Ready state after you upload. You can
      check the resource status using the cde resource list-events --name
        $RESOURCE_NAME command.
After you upload the resource, activate the environment to use it in the Airflow
          jobs.

cde airflow activate-pyenv --pyenv-resource-name $RESOURCE_NAME 
You can check if the resource is activated using the cde airflow
              get-active-pyenv command.
