Uploading the resource to build the Python environment 
After you create the resource, you have to upload the resource to build your
    environment.Create a requirements.txt file specifying the Python package and
      version dependencies required by your CDE job.
Upload the requirements.txt file to the resource.

cde resource upload --name $RESOURCE_NAME --local-path requirements.txt

This launches a job that builds the Python environment from the requirement.txt
      file. You can check the status of this job using the cde resource
        list-events --name $RESOURCE_NAME command. The Python resource must be in the
        Ready state after you upload and before you activate it.
