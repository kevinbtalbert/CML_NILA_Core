Managing heterogenous GPU nodes
If you have heterogeneous GPU nodes and want to run Spark jobs or sessions on a
    specific GPU node, then the Kubernetes platform administrator must add the node labels and
    taints. You can use the below commands to manage labels and taint the node.

Add Node
            Labelkubectl label nodes worker-node1 nvidia.com/gpu=a100
Remove Node
              Labelkubectl label nodes worker-node1 nvidia.com/gpu-If you
              want to control running CPU workloads on GPU nodes, it is recommended to set node
              taint.
Add
            Taintkubectl taint nodes worker-node1 nvidia.com/gpu=true:NoSchedule
Remove
            Taintkubectl taint nodes worker-node1 nvidia.com/gpu=true:NoSchedule-

After you add label and taint to the nodes, data engineers can provide node selectors
        and tolerations during the Spark job submission. For more information about adding node
        lables and taints, see Node Labels and Taints and Tolerations.
      For information about using labels and taints when creating CDE Jobs, see Creating jobs in
      Cloudera Data Engineering.
