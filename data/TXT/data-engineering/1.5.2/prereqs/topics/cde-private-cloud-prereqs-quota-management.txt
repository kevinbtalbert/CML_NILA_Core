Quota Management
GPU resources are limited in the cluster and all Data Services, that is, CML and CDE
    can share or dedicatedly set resource quota for their experience. Cloudera recommendeds to set
    the GPU resource quota so that each data service can use the allocated GPU resources
    effectively. Sharing GPU resources might lead to resource contention and delayed POD allocation. 
 Cloudera recommendeds to preallocate GPU resources quota for each Data Service using
        resource pool. For information about configuring resource pool, see Managing cluster
          resources using Quota Management.
Following is an example illustration of GPU resource allocation:
