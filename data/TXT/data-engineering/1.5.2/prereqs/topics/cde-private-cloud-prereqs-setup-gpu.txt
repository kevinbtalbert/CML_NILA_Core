GPU nodes setup
You can add the GPU hardware to the existing or new ECS or OCP cluster as a worker
    node. 
For information about GPU hardware requirements, see Additional resource requirements
        for CDE.
You must install nvidia-container-toolkit on the worker node. For more on
        nvidia-container-runtime migration to
        nvidia-container-toolkit, see Migration Notice. For information about the installation, NVIDIA Installation Guide. If using Red Hat Enterprise
      Linux (RHEL), use dnf to install the package. For an example with RHEL 8.7,
      see Installing the NVIDIA Container Toolkit.
You can use following options to advertise the GPUs in the Kubernetes cluster:


Nvidia device plugin: In ECS installation, if the Nvidia drivers are correctly
          installed, the Nvidia-device-plugin automatically advertises the GPU resource to the
          scheduler. Platform administrator need not deploy the Nvidia device plugin. 


Node Feature Discovery Operator (NFD) and GPU Operator: OCP administrators must
          install NFD and GPU Operator for advertising the GPU resource to the Kubernetes
          scheduler.


If the Nvidia drivers are correctly installed, the above options should advertise
      the GPU resource to the scheduler. For more information, see NVIDIA Device Plugin
      documentation.
