Creating Sessions in Cloudera Data Engineering
A Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) Session is an interactive short-lived development
    environment for running Spark commands to help you iterate upon and build your Spark workloads. 
The commands that are run in a CDE Session are called
      Statements. You can submit the Statements through the connect CLI command or the Interact tab
      in the CDE UI for a Session. Python and Scala are the supported Session types. Learn how to
      use Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) Sessions using the user interface and
      CLI.

In the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) console, click the Data
            Engineering tile. The Home page displays.

Click Sessions in the left navigation menu and then click Create
            Session.






Enter a Name for the Session.

Select a Type, for example, PySpark or
          Scala.

Select a Timeout value. 
The Session will stop after the indicated time has passed.

Optionally, enter a Description for the session.

Optionally, enter the Configurations.

Set the Compute options.


Optional: GPU Acceleration (Technical Preview): You can accelerate your
              session using GPUs. Click Enable GPU Accelerations checkbox to enable the GPU
              acceleration and configure selectors and tolerations if you want to run the job on
              specific GPU nodes. When you run this session, this particular session will request
              GPU resources. 



Click Create. 
The Connect tab displays a list of connectivity options
          available to interact with the Session. The Interact tab allows you
          to interact with the Session, and becomes available once the Session is running.

To delete a Session, open the Session and click
          Delete.

noteIf you Delete a Session, doing so will result in the
            termination of an active session and the loss of any attached logs and details.
