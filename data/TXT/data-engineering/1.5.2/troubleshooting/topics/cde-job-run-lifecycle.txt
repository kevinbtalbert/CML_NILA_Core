Viewing Job run timeline
You can view the intermediate stages of the job run at every stage during its life
    cycle in real-time.In case of a job failure, you can view the specific event and component where the job run
      failed. This reduces turnaround time during the debugging process for job run failure. You can
      see the step-by-step advancement of the job run on the UI, including all the granular details
      instead of reviewing extensive logs to obtain the same insights.

            Data Engineering tile. The CDE Home page
          displays.

          progression in the reverse chronological order for both primary and subordinate
          stages.
