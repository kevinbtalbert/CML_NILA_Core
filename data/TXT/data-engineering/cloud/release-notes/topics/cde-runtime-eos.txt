The following table specifies the planned end of support (EoS) policy schedule for Spark. All
   future dates are provided for planning purposes only and are subject to change, but with the
   expectation that dates may move later but will not move earlier. In each case, the projected EoS
   Date can be considered to be the last day of the month specified in the table below.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)


Does CDE offer Long-term support (LTS) releases?
CDE will offer LTS through underlying Spark runtimes. When running Spark jobs within CDE, you
    will have the option to choose an older Spark version. Specific versions of Spark will be
    designated LTS. This will allow you to continue running Spark jobs without any code changes.
    Since CDE job management APIs remain backwards compatible, existing automations will not be
    impacted.

What is the EoS timeline for Spark runtimes designated LTS?

Spark runtimes designated as LTS will follow the Cloudera Data Platform Private Cloud Base
    runtime LTS policy which is typically four years. Refer to the table above for details. 

What is the EOS timeline for non-LTS Spark runtimes?

Spark runtimes that are not designated as LTS will follow a two year EoS policy from the date
    they are introduced into CDE.
