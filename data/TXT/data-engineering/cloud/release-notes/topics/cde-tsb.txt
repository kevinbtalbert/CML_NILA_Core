TSB 2022-588: Kubeconfig and new version of
          aws-iam-authenticator
Regenerate Kubeconfig and in conjunction use a newer version of aws-iam-authenticator on
          AWS. Kubeconfig in Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) Public Cloud Data Services needs to be
          regenerated because the Kubeconfig generated before June 15, 2022 uses an old APIVersion
            (client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1) which is no longer supported. This causes
          compatibility issues with aws-iam-authenticator starting from v0.5.7. To be able to use the new
          aws-iam-authenticator, the Kubeconfig needs to be regenerated.
