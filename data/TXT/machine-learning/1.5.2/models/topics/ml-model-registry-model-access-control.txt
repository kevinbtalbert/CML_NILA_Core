Model access control
Access to models is dependent on the user permissions, as described here.

Only Administrators are able to see all models, including those not created by them.
A users who is an Owner of a given model can set the public or private visibility of the
    model through the Model Registry UI.
When a user registers a new model, that user is the Owner, and no other user has access.
A user can make a model Public, and then all users receive Viewer access to the model by default.
