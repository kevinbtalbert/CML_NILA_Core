Enabling Quota Management in CML 
After following these steps, you will be able to use the Quota Management feature in
        CML. 

Go to the Cloudera Private Cloud cluster. 

Edit the CML Control Plane deployment: 

kubectl get deploy dp-mlx-control-plane-app -n cdp-namespace -o yaml
> file-name

This will save the CML control plane deployment specification.
                

Take a backup of the above file.

Search for the environment variable ‘ENABLE_UMBRA_INTEGRATION’ in the
                        file, and change the value to true.

Save the deployment file and run:
kubectl apply -f file-name.yamlWait
                    for the new pod to come up.

Verify:

kubectl get pods -n cdp-namespace
