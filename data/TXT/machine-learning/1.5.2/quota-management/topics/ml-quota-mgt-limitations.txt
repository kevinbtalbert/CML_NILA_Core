Limitations
This section provides an overview of the limitations for CML quota
  management.


In the Tech Preview release, ‘root.default’ resource pool should not be used to
     provision CML workspace. At least one resource pool should be created for CML.
If the resource pool gets deleted, underlying CML workspace and workloads will be
     deleted. But there will be stale entries in the CML UI reflecting that the workspace still
     exists but underlying applications on the cluster will be deleted.
If the quota for users is modified, it will be reflected when the next workload
     (session or job) is submitted.
