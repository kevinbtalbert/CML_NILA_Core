Provision a workspace using a configured resource pool
Provisioning a workspace is the same as it was before quota management, with
        additional configurations for the quota for specified workspaces.

CML reserves 30 GB Memory and 20 CPU for the CML workspace
                installation.
The minimum requirement for a CML workspace to be provisioned is 38 GB of
                Memory and 22 CPU.






In this example out of 45 GB, 30 GB and 20 Cores will be reserved for CML workspace. The
            rest is available for CML workloads.
