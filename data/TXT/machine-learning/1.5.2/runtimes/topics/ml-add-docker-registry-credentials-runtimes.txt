Add Docker registry credentials and certificates
To enable Cloudera Machine Learning to fetch custom ML Runtimes from
  a secure repository, as Administrator you need to add Docker registry credentials.
Add Docker Registry Credentials to CML
Create a kubectl secret named regcred for your secured
    Docker registry. The following command creates the secret in your Kubernetes cluster:
    kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred 
    --docker-server=<server host> 
    --docker-username=<username> 
    --docker-password=<password> 
    -n <compute namespace eg. mlx>
The next time the ML Runtime image is pulled, the new secret will be picked up.

noteConsult the documentation of your chosen docker registry to
     understand what docker login credentials it expects. The expected credentials might be
     different from your own username and password. Many registries require docker authentication
     using tokens or API keys.
     kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred 
    --docker-server=<server host> 
    --docker-username=AWS 
    --docker-password=$(aws ecr get-login-password --region <region>)
    -n <compute namespace eg. mlx>
noteYou need to add these credentials to CML again if you back up and and then restore your
     CML workspace.


Add Docker registry certificates to CDP
If the Custom Runtime repository uses self-signed TLS certificates, those certificates must be
    trusted by CDP prior to creating the CML workspace. See the necessary steps to make CDP trust
    the self signed certificates in Updating TLS certificates.
