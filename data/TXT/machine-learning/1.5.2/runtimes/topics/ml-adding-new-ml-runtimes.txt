Adding new ML Runtimes
CML provides two ways to add new Runtimes to the Runtime Catalog.
noteYou must have system administrator permission to add a new ML Runtime.

Adding Custom ML Runtimes through the Runtime Catalog Create your own Custom ML Runtime
     and add it through the Runtime Catalog
Adding ML Runtimes using Runtime Repo files Host a file from where CML will automatically
     pull in new ML Runtimes and add them to the Runtime Catalog.

When adding Runtimes from a third party repository, you might need to add Docker credentials
   and certificates to CML. See more on the Add Docker registry credentials and
    certificates page.
