Ephemeral storage
Ephemeral storage space is scratch space a CML session, job, application or model can
  use. This feature helps in better scheduling of CML pods, and provides a safety valve to ensure
  runaway computations do not consume all available scratch space on the node.
By default, each user pod in CML is allocated 0 GB of scratch space, and it is allowed to use
   up to 10 GB. These settings can be applied to an entire site, or on a per-project basis.
Change Site-wide Ephemeral Storage Configuration
In Site Administration > Settings > Advanced, you can see the fields to change
    the ephemeral storage request (minimum) and maximum limit.




Override Site-wide Ephemeral Storage Configuration
If you want to customize the ephemeral storage settings, you can do so on a per-project basis.
    Open your project, then click on Project Settings > Advanced and adjust the ephemeral storage
    parameters.
