HuggingFace Spaces and Community AMPs
You can run HuggingFace Spaces or Community AMPs, which are both types of machine
  learning projects, in your CML workspace. In the HuggingFace tab in AMPs are several HF spaces
  that are tested and supported on CML.



HuggingFace is an online community for machine learning (Hugging Face). It serves as a repository for machine
   learning projects and datasets. Spaces are individual projects or applications. Community AMPs
   are machine learning prototypes created by the CML community.
There are a few things to keep in mind when launching HuggingFace Spaces or Community AMPs in
   your CML workspace.

To launch a HuggingFace project, you first need to create a free account on HuggingFace and obtain an access token.
Make sure that the Hugging Face project actually works. Many of the projects are community-created projects that may be experimental or no longer maintained.
The HuggingFace Space must use the gradio or streamlit libraries to run on CML.
The Community tab is not visible by default. To enable this tab, in Site Administration > Settings, select: Allow users to deploy community AMPs.



Enable users to deploy external spaces
By default, users cannot deploy Hugging Face spaces outside the curated collection in
  the Hugging Face tab.
To enable users to deploy external Hugging Face spaces, in Site Administration > Settings, select: 
Allow users to deploy external Hugging Face Space

When selected, the ability to deploy external HuggingFace spaces is available.


Launch a HuggingFace or Community project
You can launch a HuggingFace Space or community project by clicking
   Deploy for the respective space.
In Configure Project, you can set some parameters for the space.
If needed, enter your Hugging Face access token. The environment variables
    HF_TOKEN and HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN both require
   the same value.
noteDo not reduce any of the values specified for cpu, memory, or gpu.
Click Launch Project to deploy the project in your workspace. CML will
   run scripts to download the project from the HuggingFace space and install it in CML. This
   process can take some time.


Launch a HuggingFace Space outside the catalog
It is also possible to deploy Hugging Face spaces that are not included in the
  AMP catalog. Note that there are several caveats on which HuggingFace spaces may be able to work
  in CML, as described above.
Click Deploy External to open the UI for launching an external project,
   and follow the instructions. The project is imported from HuggingFace or the specified
   repository
