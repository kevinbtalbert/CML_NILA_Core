Burstable CPUs
CML configures no upper bound on the CPU resources that Workloads can use so that they
  can use all of the CPU resources available on the node where they are running. By configuring no
  CPU limits, CML enables efficient use of the CPU resources available on your cluster
  nodes.

If the CPUs are idle then the workloads can burst and take advantage of the free CPU cycles.
    For example, if you've launched a session with 1vCPU but the code inside it requires more than
    1vCPU, the workload container can consume all the available CPU cycles on the node where it's
    launched.
When the cluster is highly utilized and CPU resources are sparse, Workloads will be limited
    to use the number of CPU resources configured in their resource profile.
If multiple containers are attempting to use excess CPU, CPU time is distributed in
    proportion to the amount of CPU initially requested by each container.
