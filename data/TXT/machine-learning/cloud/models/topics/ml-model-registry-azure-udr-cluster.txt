Creating a Model Registry on an Azure UDR Private Cluster
Use the following template CDP CLI command to create a UDR private cluster on Azure with
  a Model Registry.
You must replace the following template items with your own information.

<environment CRN>
<environment name> (in two places)
<existing NFS name>
<subnet>

Model registries are also supported on Azure private clusters with UDR. For more information
   about UDR, see the Preview Feature documentation.
If you have not yet downloaded the CDP CLI tool, see the 
   documentation.
The required CDP CLI version is version 0.9.93 or higher.

cdp ml create-model-registry --cli-input-json {
    "environmentCrn": "<environment CRN>",
    "environmentName": "<environment name>",
    "privateCluster": true,
    "usePublicLoadBalancer": false,
    "outboundTypes": [
        "OUTBOUND_TYPE_UDR"
    ],
    "provisionK8sRequest": {
        "network": {
            "topology": {
                "subnets": [                     
                  "<subnet>" # subnet with a default route configuration to forward the traffic to the network appliance or firewall. This is required to enable UDR.
                ]
            }
