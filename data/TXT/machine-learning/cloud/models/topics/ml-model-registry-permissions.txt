Model Registry permissions
Model registry permissions for the following actions are separate from workspace
  permissions, but they are inherited from environment level workspace permissions.

create
delete
getKubeconfig
grant/list/revoke access

Therefore, if you have the MLAdmin role on an environment, you can perform these actions for
   model registry, but an MLUser cannot.
Remote access to a model registry works similarly to workspace remote access. In addition to
   downloading the kubeconfig file, you need to use
    Grant/List/RevokeModelRegistryAccess endpoints to manage what cloud user
   identity can access the Kubernetes cluster using your cloud credential.
