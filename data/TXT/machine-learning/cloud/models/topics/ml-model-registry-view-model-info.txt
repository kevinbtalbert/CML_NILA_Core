Viewing registered model information


From the Projects page in CML, select Model
     Registry from the navigation pane. On the main Model
     Registry page, you can see all the models currently registered, their respective
    owners, location of creation, and the last updated time, if known.
Select a registered model to see its description. CML displays the
      Details page which outlines the model description, ID, owner, and
     versions. Different versions of the same model can be deployed in the workspace.
