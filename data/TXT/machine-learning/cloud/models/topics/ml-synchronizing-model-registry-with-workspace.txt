Synchronizing the model registry with a workspace
 If you deploy a model registry in an environment that contains one or more CML
  workspaces, you must synchronize the model registry with the workspaces.

Click Model Registry to display the Model
      Registries window.

Choose the model registry you want to synchronize with the workspaces in the
     environment.

From the Actions menu, click
     Synchronize.
Model Registry displays the Confirm dialog box listing all of the
     workspaces in the environment. 


Click OK.
