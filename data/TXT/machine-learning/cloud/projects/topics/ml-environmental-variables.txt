Environmental Variables
Environmental variables help you customize engine environments, both globally and for
      individual projects/jobs. 
For
         example, if you need to configure a particular timezone for a project or increase the
         length of the session or job timeout windows, you can use environmental variables to do
         so.
For a
         list of the environmental variables you can configure and instructions on how to configure
         them, see Engine Environment Variables.
You can create new environment variables in the following pages: 
Project Settings > Advanced
New Job > Job Settings
New Application > Application Settings
User Settings > Environment Variables
Site Administration > Runtime

To add an environmental variable: 
Enter the name and value.
Click Add
Optionally, click Hide/Show to hide the value from viewing by
               users. This can help with hiding sensitive values stored in environment variables,
               such as passwords. The value is set to Hide by default.
