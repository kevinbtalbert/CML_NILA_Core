Fixed Issues

Projects (DSE-27795) - Fixed an issue where certain public projects owned by a
          user or where the user is a collaborator were not displayed in the user's My
            Projects view.
Jobs (DSE-27535) - Fixed an issue so that a job can be created in disabled or paused state.
API v2 (DSE-27463) - Added missing fields (timezone,
          paused) to createJobRequest endpoint.
API v2 (DSE-27442) - Fixed an issue so that files in subfolders are uploaded to
          their respective subfolders, and not to a root directory, when using the
          uploadFile endpoint.
API v2 (DSE-27391) - When creating a project via API v2, the ephemeral storage
          value is now set to NULL (instead of zero). This fixed an issue that was
          blocking certain CDSW to CML migration workflows.
