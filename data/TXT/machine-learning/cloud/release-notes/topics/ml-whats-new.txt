January 23, 2024
Release notes and fixed issues for version 2.0.43-b208.
New Features / Improvements

Cloudera Data Warehouse - Automatic JWT-based authentication enables passwordless
          connectivity to CDW. Users do not need to use their workload password to query data from
          CML. This feature depends on Data Lake 7.2.18, please upgrade your environment when the
          new version is available.
Redesigned AMP Catalog - The AMPs pane is redesigned to improve navigation and
          search capabilities.
HuggingFace Spaces - A curated list of HuggingFace Spaces is available in the
          AMPs Catalog.
Community AMPs - A selected list of community-created AMPs is available to run in
          CML in the AMPs pane.
Azure - Support for new GPU instances: NVadsA10 v5-series (non-fractional)
Azure - Certificate based authentication using Managed Identity to provision in
          AKS.
AWS - Support for new GPU instances: g5
AWS - Deprecated support for P2 instance types.
AWS - Added support for CML workspaces in af-south-1, Africa
          (Cape Town) region.
Kubernetes - Kubernetes version 1.27 is supported on both Azure and AWS.
Restore workflow - Improved reliability of the workspace restore workflow.
Private DNS Zone - CML now certified to work with private DNS zones.
Project Migration tool - A command line argument is added to check if source and
          destination files are the same, covering job, app, model, project data and metadata
          files.
Runtimes - The R version of cmladdon is upgraded to version
          4.3.1.
Runtimes - The HadoopCLI 7.2.17.100 Runtime Addon is released for the Public
          Cloud.
Runtimes - ML Users can now register custom ML Runtimes. A new site-level
          configuration option has been introduced on the Site Administration page to enhance
          runtime registration capabilities: 
Admins can enable a configuration option, granting users the capability to
              register runtimes.
The new option is disabled by default, ensuring that existing permissions remain
              unchanged.
With this update, we've implemented a mechanism to record the names of the users
              who register ML Runtimes, displayed on the Runtime Catalog Page.
Users now can add runtimes however, it's important to note that they are not
              permitted to deprecate/disable the added runtimes.

Runtimes - We have introduced a new button in the Site Administration > Runtime tab, where users are now able to update the Runtimes catalog at any time
          based on runtime repos.
Runtimes - On the Project creation page: 
Renamed the Runtime setup section to
            Runtime.
Updated the UI for Basic/Advanced option selection.
Modified basic configuration settings.
Added GPU-enabled runtime variant by default.

Security - When adding project collaborators or team members, non-admins can be
          prevented from seeing the entire user list. This functionality can be restricted to Site
          Admins in Site Administration > Security by selecting Allow all authenticated users to access
            /api/v1/users endpoint.
Teams - The ownership structure for team creation is changed. Previously, the
          creator of a team was assigned the role of Owner. Now, the creator
          is assigned the role of Admin by default. Admins have the authority
          to add team members, including other admins. Each team must have at least one admin to
          manage the team.

          skipped if no load balancer is specified during workspace creation.
DSE-23953 - Fixed a problem where worker subnet validation is skipped if no load
          balancer is specified during workspace creation.
