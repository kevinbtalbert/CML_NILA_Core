Adding new ML Runtimes
CML provides two ways to add new Runtimes to the Runtime Catalog.
noteYou must have system administrator permission to add a new ML Runtime. Alternatively, in Site Administration > Settings > Access Control, an admin can enable Allow users to register ML Runtimes. If enabled, the names
      of users who register ML Runtimes is displayed on the Runtime Catalog page. Users are not
      permitted to deprecate or disable the added runtimes.

Adding Custom ML Runtimes through the Runtime Catalog Create your own Custom ML Runtime
     and add it through the Runtime Catalog
Adding ML Runtimes using Runtime Repo files Host a file from where CML will automatically
     pull in new ML Runtimes and add them to the Runtime Catalog.

When adding Runtimes to CML from password protected repositories, you need to add the necessary
   Docker credentials to CML. See more on the Add Docker registry credentials page.
