Using Runtime Catalog
You can use the Runtime catalog to list all runtimes that are available for your
    deployment.
The Runtime Catalog lists information about each of the
      available runtimes. Information includes the editor and kernel supported by the runtime along
      with the edition, version, and a brief description. Administrator users can use the
          Hide Disabled toggle so that only runtimes with
          Enabled or Deprecated status display. The
        toggle is on by default.
The Status filter also applies to runtime variants.


Click Runtime Catalog in the left Navigation bar to display a
          list of all available runtimes.
