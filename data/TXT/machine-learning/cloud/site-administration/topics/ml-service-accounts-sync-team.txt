Sync machine users from the Synced team
You can sync machine users that are part of a synced team to your
        project.

In Management Console > User Management > Groups, click Create Group.

Enter the name for the group, and click Create.

Click Add Members to search for and add group members,
                    including machine users.

To add the team (group) to your environment, go to Environments > Actions > Manage Access.

Click Update Role to update the role as follows, and
                    click Update Roles.


Environment User: Only users who have read access to the environment are
                            synced. Alternatively, you can assign the Environment User role to the
                            machine user.
MLAdmin or MLUser role: only users with either role are synced to CML
                            workspaces.



Click Synchronize Users and wait for synchronization to
                    complete. Then return to your CML workspace.

In Site Administration > Teams, select Sync Teams and then choose the
                    group to sync.

Click Create Team, and the team is created in CML.

To add members to a synced team, add them in the control plane and sync them to CML
            via the Site Administration > Teams > Sync Teams option. You cannot add users to a group manually in CML.
