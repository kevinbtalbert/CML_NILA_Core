Service Accounts
Service accounts are used by machine users that require a user account, without needing
  to use an account of an actual user.
Like other users, this machine user can be granted necessary permissions and roles, and be
   added as a collaborator to projects in order to run workloads. Machine users can also create
   projects and workloads.
